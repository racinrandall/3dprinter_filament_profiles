= 3D Printers and Filament Profiles

This will be a collection of printer and filament profiles for printers I have, and the filaments I use.

With the exception of the Creality K2+ and Bambu H2D, all other profiles are for Orca Slicer.  At the time of this writing I am using version 2.3 on Linux, Mac and Windows, so I will ensure it works in all 3.

At some point I might add profiles for other slicers, but for now Orca is my preferred slicer.
