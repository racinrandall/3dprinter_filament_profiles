= 3D Printers and Filament Profiles
:table-caption!: 

This will be a collection of printer and filament profiles for printers I have, and the filaments I use.

As I complete the filament profile and upload it here, the items in the below table will be changed to hyperlinks to that profile.

With the exception of the Creality K2+, all other profiles are for Orca Slicer.  At the time of this writing I am using version 2.3 on Linux, Mac and Windows, so I will ensure it works in all 3.

At some point I might add profiles for other slicers, but for now Orca is my preferred slicer.
